## 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.


Example 1:
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

Example 2:
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1

# **Key Idea**
**Approach: Slinding Window**
1. **Use Two Pointer**
    - The `right` pointer expands the windows to include new elements
    - The `left` pointer shrink the window when sum is greater or equal than target
2. **Maintain the windows**
    - Maintain the minimal length when iterate the array
