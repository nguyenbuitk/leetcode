# Medium
## 11. Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

```
Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

# Key Idea
## Approach 1 - Brute force
1. Traverse all posible pair of array height to find the max area
