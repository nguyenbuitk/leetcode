## 532. K-diff Pairs in an Array
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

- `0 <= i, j < nums.length`
- `i != j`
- `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`
Notice that `|val|` denotes the absolute value of val.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,1,5], k = 2\
Output: 2\
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).\
Although we have two 1s in the input, we should only return the number of unique pairs.\
